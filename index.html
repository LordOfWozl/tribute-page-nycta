Part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the busiest and largest transit system in North America, the NYCTA has a daily ridership of 8 million trips (over 2.5 billion annually).</p>			</div>			<div class="div-image">				<img class="image-resp" src="img/magazine-1.png" alt="magazine-1">			</div>			<div class="div-text">				<h2 id="history">History</h2>				<p >The subway system today is composed of what once were three separate systems in competition with one another. Two of them were built and operated by private companies: August Belmont's Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklynâ€“Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). The third, the public Independent Subway System (IND) was owned and operated by the City of New York. The IRT and BMT systems were acquired by the city on June 1, 1940, for $317,000,000 and consolidated with the IND into the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT).</p>				<p>The buses on Staten Island had been operated by a private company operating under a franchise that expired in 1946. When it became known that the company would not renew its franchise, a group of residents in the borough organized the Isle Transportation Company, to continue operation. This group ran into financial difficulties and the city took over the company on February 23, 1947. The city then controlled all of the bus routes on Staten Island. On March 30, 1947, the City took over the bus lines of the North Shore Bus Company, which comprised half of the privately owned lines in Queens, after that company went into financial troubles. On September 24, 1948, the City acquired five bus lines in Manhattan for similar reasons.</p>				<p>The surface operation of the BOT was a costly operation, resulting from the various equipment that was required, including trolley cars, trolley coaches, gasoline and diesel buses, of which many were obsolete and in need of replacement.</p>				<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">During World War II, the New York City Transit System showed an operating surplus on the five-cent fare, because gasoline was rationed and auto riders had to abandon their cars for subway and bus travel. Factories began to work around the clock, and therefore business boomed. Transit repairs were kept at a minimum as basic materials were in short supply for civilian use. Operating revenues were raised and maintenance costs were reduced, but as a result, the future problems of deferred maintenance and falling ridership. In 1946, costs rose and profits turned to losses, and to obtain needed funds, the fare was raised in 1948 to ten cents on the subways and elevated, and to seven cents on the surface lines. This increase only produced a revenue surplus for a single year. In 1951 a uniform ten-cent fare was established on both the rapid transit and surface lines. Operating deficits continued to add up and public dissatisfaction with the transit system grew, as equipment was deteriorating, and train schedules being difficult to abide by.</p>			</div>			<div class="div-image">				<img class="image-resp" src="img/metrocard-2.png" alt="metrocard-2">			</div>			<div id="tribute-info" class="div-text">				<h2 id="about">About</h2>				<p style="padding-bottom: 300px;">This website was designed and coded by Oezden Gelgec for the Responsive Web Design Certification by <a id="tribute-link-2" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a>.			 	<br>				Read more about NYCTA on <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Transit_Authority">Wikipedia.</a>				</p>			</div>			<!-- End text -->		</main>	</body>	</html>
